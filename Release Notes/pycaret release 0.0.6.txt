pycaret beta 0.0.6 has been released. We have made fundamental progress in last few days. Some of the key achievements and updates are as follows:

It supports more than 6 different kind of topic models along with library of 40+ estimators to choose from (when learning is set to semi-supervised). plot_model function in NLP is completely interactive and makes the best use of plotly interface in python. 

-pycaret.datasets is now created. It's a big data respository hosted as github.com/pycaret/pycaret. This will allows to directly get data from our git without ever downloading and storing csv files. Example:
